---------------------------------------OSI LAYERS FOR LOAD BALANCING---------------------------------------------------
Application layer:
                      Where you define the protocol HTTP or anything from there it will go to presentation layer
presentation layer:
                      Where you will decide if it has to be a secure one you need to do any encrypting 
Session layer:
                      Where you will decide to create a session object  
Transport layer:
                      Where your request is segregated in to small small chunks and request is transmitted from the client to the server ,finally it will go routers.There will be a final router before the server 
Data link layer:
                      From this layer it can go to a switch and then cables and from cables it will reach the server

1. **Physical Layer:**
   The physical layer deals with the actual transmission and reception of data bits over a physical medium, ensuring the reliable transfer of signals through cables or wireless connections.
   
2. **Data Link Layer:**
   The data link layer establishes reliable connections between nodes on a network, framing data into packets and performing error detection to ensure accurate transmission.
   
3. **Network Layer:**
   The network layer is responsible for routing packets between different networks, determining the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination based on network conditions.
   
4. **Transport Layer:**
   The transport layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication by segmenting data into smaller packets, managing data flow, and providing error detection and correction capabilities.
   
5. **Session Layer:**
   The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications, allowing for the synchronization and organization of data exchange sessions.
   
6. **Presentation Layer:**
   The presentation layer is responsible for translating data into a format that can be easily understood by the application layer, handling tasks like data encryption, compression, and decryption.
   
7. **Application Layer:**
   The application layer serves as the interface between the network and end-users, providing services like email, file transfer, and web browsing through various protocols and applications.

ALB VS NLB VS GWLB

 Sure, here's a simple breakdown of the differences between ALB (Application Load Balancer), NLB (Network Load Balancer), and GWLB (Gateway Load Balancer):

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
   - ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
   - It is used for distributing incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances or containers, based on the content of the HTTP and HTTPS requests.

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
   - NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
   - It is designed to handle TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic, distributing incoming network traffic across multiple targets at the connection level.

3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):**
   - GWLB is a cloud-native load balancer designed to work with virtual appliances and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) workloads.
   - It sits at the edge of the network, offering scalable and secure handling of internet and VPN traffic, including advanced features for network appliances.

Remember, ALB is for HTTP/HTTPS at Layer 7, NLB is for TCP/UDP at Layer 4, and GWLB is designed for virtual appliances and edge network functionalities.

 You should choose an Application Load Balancer (ALB) when you are dealing with web applications, APIs, or microservices that use HTTP or HTTPS traffic and need advanced routing features.

You should choose a Network Load Balancer (NLB) when you have applications that require handling high volumes of TCP or UDP traffic with low latency and need static IP addresses for your backend servers.

 You should consider using Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) when you need to manage the inbound and outbound traffic to and from virtual appliances, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, in the cloud.
    It provides centralized control and inspection of traffic flowing through these virtual appliances at the network and application layers.
