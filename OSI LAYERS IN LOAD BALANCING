---------------------------------------OSI LAYERS FOR LOAD BALANCING---------------------------------------------------
Application layer:
                      Where you define the protocol HTTP or anything from there it will go to presentation layer
presentation layer:
                      Where you will decide if it has to be a secure one you need to do any encrypting 
Session layer:
                      Where you will decide to create a session object  
Transport layer:
                      Where your request is segregated in to small small chunks and request is transmitted from the client to the server ,finally it will go routers.There will be a final router before the server 
Data link layer:
                      From this layer it can go to a switch and then cables and from cables it will reach the server





1. **Physical Layer:**
   The physical layer deals with the actual transmission and reception of data bits over a physical medium, ensuring the reliable transfer of signals through cables or wireless connections.
   
2. **Data Link Layer:**
   The data link layer establishes reliable connections between nodes on a network, framing data into packets and performing error detection to ensure accurate transmission.
   
3. **Network Layer:**
   The network layer is responsible for routing packets between different networks, determining the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination based on network conditions.
   
4. **Transport Layer:**
   The transport layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication by segmenting data into smaller packets, managing data flow, and providing error detection and correction capabilities.
   
5. **Session Layer:**
   The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications, allowing for the synchronization and organization of data exchange sessions.
   
6. **Presentation Layer:**
   The presentation layer is responsible for translating data into a format that can be easily understood by the application layer, handling tasks like data encryption, compression, and decryption.
   
7. **Application Layer:**
   The application layer serves as the interface between the network and end-users, providing services like email, file transfer, and web browsing through various protocols and applications.
